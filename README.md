# Credit_Risk_Analysis

Overview of the analysis: The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the performance of different machine learning models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

Results: Below are the balanced accuracy scores of the machine learning models we used.
